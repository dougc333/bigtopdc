    <section name="Apache Bigtop"></section>
    <p>Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
    <br/><br/>
     The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the packaging and interoperability testing 
     of Hadoop-related projects. This includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, etc...) 
     developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather than individual projects.</p>
     <p>Bigtop is currently being incubated in the <a class="externalLink" href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a></p>
     <br/><br/>
    <subsection name="Building Bigtop"></subsection>
    <p>Packages have been built on Ubuntu 10.10, CentOS 5, Mageia 1 and openSUSE 11.4.
    They can probably be built on other platforms as well.<br/><br/>
    Building Bigtop requires the following tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java JDK 1.6</li>
      <li>Apache Forrest 0.8 (requires 32bit version of Java JDK 1.5)</li>
      <li>Apache Ant</li>
      <li>Apache Maven</li>
      <li>git</li>
      <li>subversion</li>
      <li>autoconf</li>
      <li>automake</li>
      <li>liblzo2-dev</li>
      <li>libzip-dev</li>
      <li>sharutils</li>
      <li>libfuse-dev</li>
      <li>libssl-dev</li>
      <li>asciidoc</li>
      <li>xmlto</li>
      <li>libssl-dev</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On Debian-based systems one also needs</p>
    <ul>
      <li>build-essential dh-make debhelper devscripts</li>
      <li>reprepro</li>
    </ul>
    <subsection name="Disclaimer"></subsection>
    <p>
       Apache Bigtop is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
      sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
      communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
      it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
